The purpose of the present study was to review the ankle magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) scans of patients without a history of ankle trauma or lateral ankle pain to determine whichanatomic variants correlate with peroneal tendon pathologic features and noted pathophysiology. A total of\n500 MRI scans were screened, 108 (41.90 /C620.42) of which met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus brevis\ntendon was intact in 104 MRI scans (96.30%), and the peroneus longus tendon was intact in 108 (100.00%). The\nresults of the present study have con \ufb01rmed statistically signi \ufb01cant correlations between the presence of an os\nperineum and tendinopathy of the peroneus longus [r\ns(106) \u00bc0.27], undulating peroneal grooves and the\nseverity of peroneal brevis tears [r s(106) \u00bc0.32], a boomerang-shaped peroneus brevis tendon and increasing\ntendinopathy of the peroneal tendons [brevis (r s(106) \u00bc0.37; longus r s(106) \u00bc0.33], and low-lying muscle\nbellies and chronic injuries of the superior peroneal retinaculum (r f\u00bc0.19). However, the present study did\nnot\ufb01nd evidence to support the presumed correlations between peroneal tendon pathologic \ufb01ndings and\nhypertrophied peroneal tubercles, low-lying muscle bellies, or the peroneus quartus muscle. Adding to thepublished data, the present study found a statistically signi \ufb01cant correlation between undulating peroneal\ngrooves and an increasing prevalence of osteophytes within the peroneal groove [r\ns(106) \u00bc0.32]. MRI \ufb01ndings\nof anatomic variants or peroneal pathologic features might be useful for injury prevention; however, we advisecaution from using the \ufb01ndings alone to advocate surgical intervention.

Given the number and close proximity of soft tissue structures\nwithin the foot and ankle, false-positive and false-negative results can\noccur. Therefore, a diagnosis should not be made solely from the MRI\nevaluation.\nMultiple studies have con \ufb01rmed an accuracy of 83% in detecting\npathologic features of the foot and ankle (12,13) . Despite previous\nstudies reporting greater accuracy (13,14) , Kuwada (12) reported a 57%\nsensitivity and deemed peroneal injuries the most challenging patho-logic entity to identify. The sensitivity and speci \ufb01city of detecting\nperoneal injury appears to vary depending on the tendon and patho-logic entity of interest (13\u201316).L a m me ta l (13) showed that the sensi-\ntivity and speci \ufb01city for detecting peroneus brevis tears was 83% and\n75%, respectively, and Rademaker et al (14) reported 100% accuracy in\nidentifying peroneus longus tears in 9 patients. In a recent investigation,\n97 MRI scans were reviewed and compared with the surgical \ufb01ndings\n(16). Tears of the peroneus brevis were detected with 44% sensitivityand\n99% speci \ufb01city, and swelling in the peroneus brevis was detected with\n50% sensitivity and 99% speci \ufb01city. Tears of the peroneus longus were\ndetected with 50% sensitivity and 96% speci \ufb01city, and swelling in the\nperoneus longus was detected with 100% sensitivity and 96% speci \ufb01city.\nThe investigators concluded that MRI is diagnostically speci \ufb01c but not\nsensitive when evaluating peroneal tendon pathologic features (16).\nPositioning plays a critical role for consistent imaging and visual-\nization of soft tissue structures within the ankle (13). The \u201cmagic\nangle \u201dphenomenon is the pseudoappearance of torn structures,\nwhich leads to false-positive results. This occurs when \ufb01bers form an\nangle of approximately 55\n/C14with the primary magnet vector, which\ncauses increased signal intensity within healthy tendons (17). The\nperoneal tendons have been recognized as especially susceptible tothis, given their descent down the ankle (17). However, investigators\nhave suggested that the magic angle phenomenon can be reduced bypositioning the ankle in 20\n/C14of plantar \ufb02exion (17,18) . Although MRI\nhas documented pitfalls, it is a valuable diagnostic tool for identifyinginjuries of the peroneal tendons.\nUsing MRI evaluation, Saupe et al (19) demonstrated that many of\nthe anatomic variants potentially associated with peroneal tendon\ndisorders are present in asymptomatic individuals. Approximately 17%\nof the asymptomatic population had a peroneus quartus muscle, 72%had\ufb01bular grooves typically associated with tendon irritation and\ndislocation, and peroneal tubercles were present in 55% of volunteers.In a subsequent MRI investigation, Saxena et al (20) established that\napproximately 30% of asymptomatic individuals will demonstratelateral ankle pathologic features. Accordingly, foot and ankle surgeons\nwill often encounter peroneal pathologic features intraoperatively\ndespite the patient never having reported lateral ankle pain. Although\nboth studies provided valuable information regarding the lateral ankle\nin asymptomatic patients, the relationship between the anatomic\nvariants and peroneal pathologic features was not elucidated. After\nconducting a thorough review of the published data, we were unable to\n\ufb01nd any comprehensive studies that conveyed the association between\nanatomic variants known to predispose asymptomatic individuals toperoneal tendon disorders and those disorders.\nThe purpose of the present study was to review ankle MRI scans\nfrom patients without a history of ankle trauma or suspected lateral\nankle pathologic entities and determine which anatomic variants\ncorrelated with the peroneal tendon pathologic features and relevant\npathophysiology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6148617-1971-4555-802e-218891eae0d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6148617-1971-4555-802e-218891eae0d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad82ff7-0eb7-4f08-bee6-a92a11350964", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "3852f9cdf3ecd3b7d545c41d3c1763c3800ef857b24bfd5c64436fa240d3d1f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "f13ca232-7aaf-4da5-b644-407454b6792e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "ebff0d38b32cca80df7920a94b323cfa5f086d4be0e0824de8d7a8de2a815fa6"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef7858e2-9345-41e8-ba14-ac48454fe95b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "346a0cb342f7c70e3489b2f373d18731919293754ab3cc040832561dbe38bfc9"}}, "hash": "81bcba9f4825037e6d0f1f7394026be28d01f574617064a8bf04fe3833fc186a", "text": "We hypothesized that the prevalence of peroneal\ntendon pathologic \ufb01ndings and relevant pathophysiology would\ncorrelate with the anatomic variants presumed to increase peronealtendon injury, speci \ufb01cally, the presence of a peroneus quartus muscle,\nhypertrophied peroneal tubercles, low-lying peroneus brevis musclebellies, and os perineum. We also examined the correlations betweenpatient demographics (age and gender) and peroneal tendon patho-logic features and relevant pathophysiology. Finally, we conducted a\ncomparison of our results with those previously reported for\nasymptomatic lateral ankles (19,20) .\nPatients and Methods\nAims\nThe primary aim of the present retrospective radiographic study was to determine\nwhether any correlations exist between peroneal tendon pathologic features and the\nobserved anatomic variants presumed to increase the likelihood of peroneal tendoninjury in a patient population without lateral ankle symptoms. Secondarily, we soughtto determine whether any correlations exist between patient demographics (age andgender) and noted pathologic features of the peroneal tendons (peroneal tendonpathologic features and relevant pathophysiology). As a tertiary aim, we compared our\ufb01ndings with those of previous studies investigating the incidence of anatomic variants\n(19) and peroneal pathologic features (20) in patients with asymptomatic lateral ankles.\nAssessors\nUsing our electronic imaging system, a single fellowship-trained surgeon (M.M.G)\nreviewed all ankle MRIs ordered within our institution (Coordinated Health), theirordering criteria, and the associated radiology reports to determine whether the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria were met ( Table 1 ). The contributory patient\ndemographics were recorded. These consisted of patient age (years), gender (male or\nfemale), and imaged side (right or left). Once a MRI scan had been determined to meetthe inclusion criteria, it was simultaneously re-evaluated by 2 musculoskeletal-trainedradiologists with 19 years of combined experience (A.D.M., E.M.M.). A consensus on thepresence and nature of the pathologic \ufb01ndings was reached and recorded. Statistical\nanalyses were performed by the research associate (N.M.P.) at our institution.\nStudy Population\nA database search was conducted in the radiology department for all ankle MRI\nexaminations ordered by attending orthopedic and podiatric physicians from\nDecember 27, 2011 to April 9, 2013. The sample size was determined for correlationsaccording to 90% power, an\naof 0.05, and a correlation coef \ufb01cient of 0.30, which\nrequired a minimum of 92 MRI examinations. The data were recorded into a password-\nprotected, secure database. The con \ufb01dentiality and privacy of the patients were\nensured and maintained. The institutional review board granted an exemption for our\nresearch project, approved the protocol, and waived the requirement for informedconsent.\nEndpoints\nTwo musculoskeletal radiologists (A.D.M., E.M.M.) reassessed the MRI scans that\nhad met the inclusion criteria. Speci \ufb01cally, they evaluated the peroneal tendons while\nnoting the related pathophysiology and anatomic variants. The shape of the peroneus\nbrevis and longus were categorized as anatomic, boomerang, or \ufb02at (Figs.1 and 2 ). Next,\nthe peroneal tendons were assessed for tendinopathy and tears. Tendinopathy wasgraded as mild, moderate, or severe ( Fig. 3 ), and tears were categorized as a longitu-\ndinal split ( Fig. 4 ), partial, or full.

Tendon subluxation or dislocation was noted when the peroneal tendon was\npartially out or lateral to the \ufb01bular groove, respectively (10) (Fig. 5 ).\nThe anatomic variants consisted of peroneal tubercle hypertrophy, a low-lying\nperoneus brevis muscle belly, os perineum, peroneal groove shape, and peroneusquartus. The peroneal tubercles were evaluated for hypertrophy and graded as mild,moderate, severe, or severe with edema. The peroneal groove shape was characterizedsimilar to the criteria proposed by Wang et al (17)as\ufb02at, convex, concave, or undulating\n(Fig. 6 ). The presence of a low-lying muscle belly was noted ( Fig. 7 ). The dorsi \ufb02exed\nposition is well known to produce a positional artifact of a low-lying muscle belly. Thus,our imaging protocol required the foot to be held in a neutral position using a standardboot, which minimizes this artifact and simulated the stance phase of gait. The mus-culotendinous junction was de \ufb01ned as the location at which the muscle belly was not\nvisible when followed from its distal to its proximal insertion. A low-lying peroneusmuscle belly was de \ufb01ned as an extension of the muscle tissue distal to the \ufb01bular tip\n(1,22) . The presence of an os perineum was de \ufb01ned as a discrete area of bone marrow\nsignal intensity or cartilage signal intensity with all pulse sequences (17). If the os\nperineum was present, the radiologists also noted the presence or absence of edema.The presence of an accessory peroneus quartus muscle was assessed. The peroneusquartus muscle was de \ufb01ned as a muscle arising from the lower leg with variable\ninsertions (23). If it could not be distinguished, it was classi \ufb01ed as equivocal.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using IBM\n/C210SPSS/C210Statistics software, version 20\n(Armonk, NY). Statistical analyses were performed to determine the presence ofperoneal pathologic features and the correlation between concomitant pathologicentities.\nFisher \u2019s exact tests were used to compare the pathologic \ufb01ndings between the\nperoneal tendons (brevis and longus) and the incidence between those found in the\npresent study and in previous reports. Point biserial correlations were run to determine\nthe strength and direction of the relationship between dichotomous and continuousvariables. Spearman \u2019s rank order correlations were used to determine the strength and\ndirection of the relationship between ordinal variables and continuous variables, 2ordinal variables, and ordinal and dichotomous variables. The phi correlation coef \ufb01-\ncient was reported when both variables were dichotomous.\nThe signi \ufb01cance level for all statistical tests was set at p\u00bc.05, unless otherwise\nnoted.

Also, the prevalence of peroneal\ntendon pathologic features noted in the present study was compared\nwith the prevalence previously reported in asymptomatic individuals\n(20) (Table 11 ). The previous study reported a signi \ufb01cantly greater\nprevalence of peroneus brevis tears and peroneus longus tears(p<.001, p<.001, respectively) (20). However, the present study\nnoted a signi \ufb01cantly greater prevalence of peroneus quartus muscles\n(p\u00bc.002).\nDiscussion\nThe goal of the present retrospective study was to review the ankle\nMRI scans of an asymptomatic peroneal, nontraumatic patient pop-\nulation and correlate the anatomic variants theorized to predispose\nindividuals to peroneal tendon injury. We hypothesized that the\nprevalence of peroneal tendon pathologic features would correlate\nwith the anatomic variants presumed to increase peroneal tendon\ninjury. We further investigated how age and gender relate to the\npresence of peroneal tendon pathologic features and relatedpathophysiology. Finally, we compared the incidence of anatomicvariants and peroneal pathologic features from our study with that\nfrom previous studies reporting similar data in asymptomatic patient\npopulations. Although a number of correlations con \ufb01rmed the pre-\nsumed associations between the anatomic variants and peronealtendon pathologic features, a number of these associations did notextend to our asymptomatic patient population. These \ufb01ndings could\nindicate that speci \ufb01c anatomic variants do not predispose the pero-\nneal tendons to a pathophysiologic state as once theorized or, alter-\nnatively, predicate postinjury.\nPeroneal Tendons\nThe peroneus longus muscle originates from the proximal \ufb01bular\nhead to the proximal two thirds of the \ufb01bula and inserts onto the\nplantar base of the \ufb01rst metatarsal and medial cuneiform. The per-\noneus brevis muscle originates from the lower two thirds of the\nlateral \ufb01bula and inserts onto the base of the \ufb01fth metatarsal. Both\nperoneal muscles pass behind the lateral malleolus through a \ufb01bro-\nosseous tunnel, sharing a common synovial sheath. In the present\nstudy, a strong, positive correlation was found between tendinopathy\nof the peroneus brevis and tendinopathy of the peroneus longus,\nindicating that as tendinopathy within the peroneus brevis tendon\nincreases, tendinopathy within the peroneus longus will also increase.\nSimilarly, a statistically signi \ufb01cant weak correlation was found be-\ntween tears of the peroneus brevis and tendinopathy of the peroneuslongus, suggesting that with increased tearing of the peroneus brevis,\ntendinopathy within the peroneus longus also increases. The positive\ncorrelation between peroneus brevis and peroneus longus pathologic\nfeatures might be attributable to the tendinosis often seen in theperoneal longus and crowding of the peroneal brevis tendon from the\nclose proximity within the peroneal groove. Given the intimate rela-\ntionship of the peroneal tendons, it is not surprising that pathologic\nfeatures of 1 tendon correlated with the pathologic features of the\nother tendon, even in an asymptomatic population.\nHypertrophic Peroneal Tubercle\nA prominent protuberance along the anterolateral aspect of the\ncalcaneus known as the peroneal tubercle is often present. It sepa-\nrates the peroneus brevis tendon from the peroneus longus tendon.\nAlthough previous reports have shown that the peroneal tubercle is\npresent in 32% to 98% of individuals (24,25) , the present study\nFig. 5.

Hypertrophy of the\nperoneal tubercle is presumed to increase the sheer stress and irritatethe peroneus longus tendon sheath, resulting in tendon in \ufb02ammation\nand tears (8,26) . Thus, we anticipated a correlation between hyper-\ntrophied peroneal tubercles and tendinopathy of the peroneus longus\ntendon, which was not con \ufb01rmed. Additionally, we were unable to\ncorrelate the incidence of peroneus longus tears with the presence ofhypertrophied peroneal tubercles, because none of our asymptomatic\npatients had evidence of a peroneus longus tear.\nLow-Lying Muscle Belly\nThe presence of a low-lying peroneus brevis muscle belly has been\ntheorized to cause crowding in the peroneal groove, increasing SPR\nlaxity and simultaneously increasing the strain placed on the peronealtendons (6,17) . Consequently, we expected correlations between the\npresence of a low-lying muscle belly and pathologic features of the\nperoneal tendons and SPR. Although we did not \ufb01nd any statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant correlations between the presence of a low-lying muscle\nbelly and pathologic features of the peroneal tendons, a positive weak\ncorrelation was found between the presence of a low-lying muscle\nbelly and chronic injury of the SPR in our asymptomatic patient\npopulation. Given the retrospective nature of our MRI evaluation, the\npresent study was unable to prove causation or determine whether or\nwhen this injury would progress, resulting in peroneal tendon injury,\npain, and/or impaired function.\nOs Peroneum\nThe os peroneum is a sesamoid bone located within the peroneus\nlongus tendon, typically in close proximity to the cuboid bone.\nAlthough the prevalence of the os peroneum is unknown, when\nossi\ufb01ed, it is visible on 20% of foot radiographs (18,27) .

The MRI prevalence of the os peroneum in our\nasymptomatic population was 10.19% (11 patients). Despite the\nasymptomatic nature of our patients, we found a moderate, positive\ncorrelation between the presence of the os perineum and tendinop-\nathy of the peroneus longus tendon. This \ufb01nding con \ufb01rms a signi \ufb01-\ncant relationship between the presence of an os perineum andpathologic features of the peroneus longus tendon. This suggests the\npresence of osseous anatomic variants could in \ufb02uence tendinous\ndegradation, speci \ufb01cally the peroneus longus tendon. We were un-\nable to determine whether or when the observed pathologic entity\nmight become clinically symptomatic.\nPeroneal Groove Shape\nMorphologic variations in groove shape have been posited to in-\ncrease tendon irritation, subluxation, and dislocation (10,28,29) . The\n\ufb01ndings of the present study suggest that 3.70% of ankles have a\nconcave retromalleolar groove. In contrast, previous reports have\nindicated that the prevalence ranges from 28% to 82% (19,28) .\nAlthough the observed discrepancies might be attributable to ourpatient population, the results are counter to our asymptomatic as-sumptions. Considering that our patient population was composed of\nasymptomatic lateral ankles, we postulated that our incidence ofconcave retromalleolar grooves would be similar to, or slightly greater\nthan, the general population, which would presumably include\nsymptomatic individuals. However, our asymptomatic population\nexhibited a greater incidence of the morphometric features presumed\nto predispose the tendons to injury ( \ufb02at, convex, and undulating\ngrooves in 96.30%). In the present study, 1 patient (0.93%) had evi-dence of peroneal tendon subluxation and no patients had evidence of\ntendon dislocation, despite the high incidence of \ufb02attened grooves.\nHowever, a moderate positive correlation was found between undu-lating peroneal grooves and tears of the peroneus brevis. Although the\navailable evidence has been primarily anecdotal, our \ufb01ndings from\nasymptomatic lateral ankles suggest that an undulating peronealgroove might predispose the peroneal brevis to injury, speci \ufb01cally\ntearing. We also observed a moderate, positive correlation betweenundulating peroneal grooves and the presence of osteophytes within\nthe peroneal groove. Although previously uncorrelated in other\nstudies, this \ufb01nding sheds light on previous postulation that perhaps\nthe presence of osteophytes affects the shape of the peroneal groove.\nPeroneus Quartus Muscle\nThe peroneus quartus muscle is the most common accessory\nperoneal muscle. Its prevalence has varied from approximately 7% to\n22% (9,11,23).

The\npresence of the peroneus quartus muscle has been noted to cause\ncrowding within the \ufb01bro-osseous tunnel formed by the \ufb01bular\ngroove and the SPR, predisposing the peroneal brevis tendon to injury(9,11,17) . However, we did not \ufb01nd any statistically signi \ufb01cant corre-\nlations between the presence of the peroneus quartus muscle andpathologic features of the peroneus brevis tendon. In the presence of a\nperoneal brevis tendon tear, identi \ufb01cation of the numerous brevis\nslips from an accessory can be dif \ufb01cult, if not impossible, which might\nhave obscured our \ufb01ndings.\nSuperior Peroneal Retinaculum\nThe SPR forms the posterolateral border of the peroneal tendons\nwithin the \ufb01bular groove. Given their intimate relationship, SPR in-\njuries are often associated with peroneal tendon dislocations, pre-\ndisposing the peroneal tendons to tearing. Similar to the peroneal\ntendons, the SPR can be injured when the foot is dorsi \ufb02exed and the\nperoneal tendons are suddenly and forcefully contracted. SPR injurieshave also been attributed to stenosing within the retromalleolar\ngroove due a peroneus quartus muscle and a low-lying peroneus\nbrevis muscle belly (17). Adhering to expectation, we found statisti-\ncally signi \ufb01cant correlations between chronic SPR injuries and ten-\ndinopathy of the peroneus brevis and longus tendons and also tears of\nthe peroneus brevis tendon. However, only 1 case (0.93%) of sublux-\nation was found; therefore, no correlations were possible between\nSPR injury and tendon subluxation. Moreover, we found a statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant positive correlation between chronic SPR injuries and low-\nlying muscle bellies, but we did not observe a meaningful relationship\nbetween the presence of the peroneus quartus muscle and SPR injury.\nThese \ufb01ndings might suggest that the low-lying muscle belly does\npredispose the SPR to injury; however, in our asymptomatic patientpopulation, no indication was found that the peroneus quartus\nmuscle predisposes the SPR to injury.Osteophytes Within the Peroneal Groove, Retromalleolar Peroneal\nFluid, and Subluxation\nJust as one would expect, statistically signi \ufb01cant correlations were\nfound between the presence of \ufb02uid and tendinopathy of the per-\noneus brevis and longus tendons and tears of the peroneus brevis\ntendon. These \ufb01ndings indicate that as the severity of the tendinop-\nathy increases or the extent of the tear increases, the quantity of \ufb02uid\nincreases. Similarly, statistically signi \ufb01cant correlations were found\nbetween the presence of osteophytes within the peroneal groove andtendinopathy of the peroneus brevis and longus tendons and tears of\nthe peroneus brevis tendon. These \ufb01ndings suggest that an increase in\nosteophytes within the peroneal groove will be mirrored by an in-crease in the severity of tendinopathy or the extent of a tear, which\ncould be related to the proximity of the tendinous anatomy to the\nosseous architecture or could shed light on the role of genetics in bonyanabolism. However, inferring the causation of this correlation was\nbeyond the scope of our study. Because only 1 case (0.93%) of tendon\nsubluxation was found in our study, no statistically signi \ufb01cant cor-\nrelations were possible with tendon shape, tendinopathy, or tears.\nPatient Age\nIn the present study, no statistically signi \ufb01cant correlations were\nfound between patient age and peroneal tendinopathy or tears.\nHowever, statistically signi \ufb01cant, moderate correlations were found\nbetween age and the presence of osteophytes within the peronealgroo\nve and between age and retromalleolar peroneal \ufb02uid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7352c2d-cec9-402b-92da-3e51c27988d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7352c2d-cec9-402b-92da-3e51c27988d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6615e08-c370-4c0b-8f5d-17f14474b7df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "d755983bdb345b7c3175e5f4db27edc7d4cb2050a35b4759119c639bcf67ea88"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f9ad713-907e-403c-bd47-32a0fe24ec4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "9fcfbce816a68bc9e102f64969cb98c58da94a5dc1d67fdf2ec2ad6177ca6f7a"}}, "hash": "ba342fd81c782f6640b824e55c8e4d2796dcd097d197efe40d82c84448072a23", "text": "These\n\ufb01ndings indicate that an increase in age is accompanied by increases\nin the quantity of \ufb02uid and the severity of osteophytes.\nGender\nStatistically signi \ufb01cant moderate correlations were found between\ngender and tendinopathy of the peroneal tendons, with males morelikely to have tendinopathy of the peroneus brevis and peroneus\nlongus tendons.

Of the 102 MRI examinations, 67 (65.69%) had an intact\nperoneus brevis tendon and 68 (66.67%) had an intact peroneus\nlongus tendon. Compared with the present study, Saxena et al (20)\nreported a signi \ufb01cantly greater percentage of asymptomatic pa-\ntients with tears of the peroneal tendons. Also, 1 accessory peroneal\ntendon (0.98%) was noted in their study (20). In contrast, the present\nstudy found a signi \ufb01cantly greater prevalence of peroneus quartus\nmuscles (n \u00bc14; 12.96%). Although notable differences were found\nin the incidence of anatomic variants and peroneal pathologic fea-tures, a number of methodologic differences between the studies\nhave the potential to confound the comparisons, including patient\nselection, interobserver variability in the MRI examinations, and the\npotential for false-positive and false-negative results.\nThe present study had a number of limitations that could threaten\nthe validity of our conclusions. Perhaps the most substantial meth-odologic shortcoming of our investigation was its retrospective\ndesign. As such, our primary inclusion criteria were dependent on\nmultiple radiology technologists inputting accurate indication criteria\nand inclusive dictations. Given the quantity and concentration of\nstructures along the lateral ankle, room for error exists in MRI inter-\npretation (30). Consequently, to minimize error, we chose 2 muscu-\nloskeletal radiologists with 19 years of combined experience toreview our MRI scans. Ideally, however, truly asymptomatic ankles\nwould be used for examination rather than patients with pathologic\nfeatures located within the hindfoot and ankle. Compensation of 1\nsymptomatic aspect of the ankle might have resulted in pathologic\nfeatures elsewhere in the areas studied. Although the method for\ndescribing hindfoot valgus has been used elsewhere in studies of MRI\nexaminations, the true degree of hindfoot valgus cannot be assessed\nbecause the MRI studies were obtained using non-weightbearing\npositions, and standing radiographs were unobtainable. The place-\nment of the ankle in a neutral coil brought the extremity out of plantar\n\ufb02exion, which can minimize the magic angle phenomenon. Our study\ndescribed associations in the deformity severity and soft tissuepathologic features; however, causal and linear relationships between\nthese \ufb01ndings could not be established. Statistically, we did not un-\ndertake a sensitivity analysis to estimate the in \ufb02uence that unmea-\nsured variables could have had on our results. Despite these\nlimitations, we believe that the results of the present investigation are\na valuable addition to the published data and could be used in the\ndevelopment of future prospective cohort studies to identify patients\nat high risk of peroneal pathologic \ufb01ndings.\nFor the asymptomatic population, the present study is the \ufb01rst to\nreport a patient population in which the anatomic variants were pre-sented with and without subsequent peroneal pathologic features. MRI\n\ufb01ndings of anatomic variants or peroneal pathologic \ufb01ndings might\ncause a clinician to consider surgery or recommend an athlete wear anankle brace during sports activities, thus attempting to prevent violentmotions that increase crowding of the groove. We caution from using\nour\ufb01ndings alone to determine the treatment of this patient popula-\ntion. Although the identi \ufb01cation of factors that could predispose the\nperoneal tendons to injury is valuable, in many cases, the evidence has\nbeen anecdotal and a causal relationship has not been demonstrated.\nTo de \ufb01ni\ntively assess causation, prospective, long-term cohort studies\nare needed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c0c492f-995c-4394-a413-9c4da35d46b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c0c492f-995c-4394-a413-9c4da35d46b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d2dfca7-7cee-40a1-8933-d045127eed34", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "74f7aaa089126f655fd65fe5701e4f91037b19ba65b1d60743acecc19b157574"}, "2": {"node_id": "87fef8d2-3cd1-4a2d-8724-ab8e5e6ec779", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "abb8b63bda586e5d93508ff6f77c419b13951665e3e19324a345fe366f7be97c"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c6205dd-fdff-415d-b646-f40f611ea0c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "Galli_2015_Examination_of_anatomic_variants.pdf"}, "hash": "1be74e08032de96b2f90f98c8573d8a4e40b81b879de9809f0dd5ba7c361db28"}}, "hash": "9a90efa3bce8ffb47ca842461652c635ff59c7a3e30473c81d80e3141f2dd61f", "text": "These studies could also assist in determining the effectsour\ufb01ndings (i.e., how the presence MRI \ufb01ndings play out in the long-\nterm, regarding patient subjective, clinical, and functional data).Acknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Mohammad Khan, MD, Valley Radiology,\nPhoenix, AZ, for his assistance with our report.\nReferences\n1.Sobel M, Geppert MJ, Olson EJ, Bohne WH, Arnoczky SP.
